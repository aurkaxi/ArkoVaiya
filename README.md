# ArkoVaiya
100 in 1 bot to manage your tasks from discord. You don't necessarily have to use a website to manage the bot (you can if you want), nor do you have to memorize ugly commands. Manage everything possible with Views, Buttons, Select Menus/Dropdown, Modals/PopUp with live preview. And high-ly customizable settings.

### This page is supposed to be an about page for the bot. Source code is not open. Sorry! [Track progress Here](https://github.com/users/aurkaxi/projects/7)
